project : adding ALB infront of the ASG
Launch template contains the configuration to initialize the EC2 instnace in the ASG
we will configure the min and max number of instances requires
ASG helps you in scaling out(adding EC2 instances) and scaling in(remoVING EC2)  OF the EC2 instances
steps: first create security groups fro ASG and ALB for ALB allowing traffic from HTTP and for ASG allowing traffic from TCP and SSH
while creating the ASG itself we need to create the load balancer (NLB OR ALB)
After creation attach the SG created to the LB 
select the autoscaling mechanisms avaialble  like target scaling ,step scalling,predictive scaling
try to impose the load on the EC2  instance and check if a new EC2 is automatically created or not.....
